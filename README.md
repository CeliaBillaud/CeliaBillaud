# Célia Billaud 👩🏻‍💻

## Hi there 👋

I'm Célia, a recent web and mobile development graduate, and I'm eager to dive into my next experience!

- 🔭 I followed a web and mobile development program, where I discovered my passion for web development. Now, I'm looking for an apprenticeship starting in January 2025.
- 💬 Ask me about the project "mareco" that I'm developing!
- 📫 Contact me: @celiabillaud on Linkedin or send me an email [celiabillaud.dev\@gmail.com](mailto:celiabillaud.dev@gmail.com?subject=Hello)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've had several careers before diving into tech—I worked in banking, managed a YouTuber, and was a videographer/photographer. I love learning new things, and I know I'll thrive in web development!
